# UI Image to Code Converter Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product Overview

### 1.1 Product Vision
**UI Image to Code Converter** is an AI-powered tool designed to help developers and designers quickly convert UI mockups and screenshots into functional code. Using the power of Claude 3.7 Sonnet, the application analyzes images of user interfaces and generates accurate HTML/CSS code that faithfully reproduces the visual design.

The application provides a simple, intuitive canvas interface where users can paste an image of any UI design. Once pasted, the AI processes the image and converts it into precise HTML and CSS code, which is then rendered directly on the canvas. Users can view, edit, and export the generated code for immediate use in their projects.

### 1.2 Target Users
- Frontend developers
- UI/UX designers
- Web developers
- Product managers
- Design teams
- Freelancers
- Code prototypers
- Non-technical stakeholders needing code implementation

### 1.3 Key Value Propositions
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Transform UI mockups into functional code in seconds
- **Pixel-Perfect Conversion**: Generate accurate HTML/CSS that matches the original design
- **Time Savings**: Eliminate hours of manual coding from design to implementation
